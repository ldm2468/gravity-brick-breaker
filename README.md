# gravity-brick-breaker
This is a libgdx based game, for desktop and android.

It's pretty much a blatant ripoff of the game "Swipe brick breaker" made by the developer Monthly 23, a popular game in Korea.
The only difference is that the balls in this game are affected by gravity. (Also, the graphics are a lot worse)

The code is pretty terrible, as most of it was written hastily in one night.
Still, I hope it may be useful.
